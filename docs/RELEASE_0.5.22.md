# 0.5.22 — Native label fonts, tutorial and parts layout

English patch for **Super Robot Taisen Z3: Tengoku-hen**, Japanese PS3 edition
**BLJS10299**. Prepared locally; creating or publishing a GitHub release
requires the user's explicit consent for this version.

## Apply

Once published, in [Retro Trans Tools](https://github.com/retro-trans/retro-trans-tools), choose
**Refresh catalog**, select either your original Japanese ISO or the exact
public 0.5.18 ISO in **Automatic**, then select **Latest** (0.5.22).
Choose a new output ISO. Both routes produce the same verified image.

For manual patching, use **Apply xdelta** with the asset whose `from` version
matches your input. `BUILD-MANIFEST.json` records each exact input/output hash
and size; keep checksum checks enabled. Game images are not distributed.

## Included

- Translate all 23 assembled item-unlock conditions, all 24 D-Trader item
  announcements, and all nine selectable Full Upgrade Bonus confirmations.
- Repair both two-color Custom Bonus award headers and the matching Ace Bonus
  header, keeping their native font, colors, icons and row pitch.
- Translate all 35 trophy names/descriptions and the trophy-set title in both
  metadata variants. Preserve IDs, hidden flags, grades, triggers and all icons.
- Correct Heero Yuy and Crowe Bluest in the glossary, Library, executable
  names, dialogue token expansions and pilot surname pieces; preserve Yui Ikari.
- Center Raise Stats / Learn Skills in all four training tab states; separate
  Owned / Cost / Left from PP and restore readable six-stat / four-terrain labels.
- Fit all nine Z Crystal effect names, including Grade 5, before the unchanged
  numeric cost column; shorten its headings to Effect / Cost.
- Separate Z Crystal payment text from the live amount and align selected
  Yes / No words with their neutral row in every confirmation state.
- Fit all 23 tutorial selector titles into their two columns. Keep every
  tutorial body in its original row, with measured English widths and controls.
- Shorten Combat Record and Power Parts captions around unchanged numbers,
  names, arrows and category choices. Match both emblem footer caption paths.
- Use the game's original Latin fill and outline masks for the reported yellow
  labels, retaining their native color, baseline and row pitch.
- Translate the Power Parts formatter's separate Air / Ground / Water table;
  preserve all eight movement masks, separators, and both comparison columns.

- Shorter Link question and PP bonus labels, preserving counts and totals.
- Default protagonist names translated in the independent mission-condition
  substitution routine; custom names, name order and saved bytes preserved.
- Compact Library Name caption, aligned SR Point award layers and a single
  highlighted bonus amount with its separate English prefix.
- English world-map domination caption; percentage digits and animation retained.
- English UI, menu/help wrapping and alignment, full Library descriptions,
  scenario chart, English title logo, retro-trans credit and version footer.
- All 197 narration records, 104 ordinary stage title variants, 83 terrain
  names, assembled Spirit targets and default-name mission conditions.
- Focus/Foc terminology, native outlined fonts, readable stat/training labels,
  compact Spirit indicators, and the enemy band's English slash between Fy and Di.
- Native caption fallback repair for stray kanji over names/blank labels.
- All 63,553 fresh dialogue records and 48,143
  battle-voice strings retained from the previous public release.

## Verification and compatibility

All 82 disc files passed both filesystem-tree checks. The final executable's
translation bindings, mission name substitution stores, reward captions,
domination atlas, Spirit band geometry, name drawer, fonts and stat widths
passed readback/execution checks. The upgrade additions also pass 80 final
lookup cases, 23 native report compositions and nine native bonus questions;
the trophy pack passes complete text/structure/icon readback and SHA-1 checks.
All 27 new widgets, 244 fixed tutorial lookups and 68 native font cells passed
final readback checks. Regression testing passed 264 tests, with two optional
checks skipped. Both patches passed complete ISO reconstruction and checksum
checks; Retro Trans 0.5.4 validated all five delivery assets.

**RPCS3 only.** Physical PS3/Vita compatibility is not claimed. In-game visual
confirmation of this exact build remains pending. The separately reported
malformed result-screen team name remains unresolved. Provisional wording and
battle-caption limitations remain recorded in the project reports.

Fresh-boot the new image and load an in-game save; emulator save states can
retain older code. Follow the prior release's installation-cache update notes
if RPCS3 continues to load old installed fonts/text. Preserve savedata.
